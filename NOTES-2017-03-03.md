Some open questions that came up during the chat 2017-03-03:

- Is there an obligation of honest players to include all "transactions"
  (in the sense of e.g. currency transactions)? Later parts of the paper
  seem to assume so, but it looks like this is never explicitly stated
  when honest behaviour is being discussed.

- Can we assume `B0` always belongs to the block chain, and fuse head with
  `H(-)` so that it becomes total?

- Why is aux needed as part of the blockchain? Is it for third-party
  validation? And how should this be realized in practice? Doesn't it make
  the blocks too large? Also, in 2c of Figure 9, it remains unclear
  whether aux is included into *every* block that is generated?

- Is `C = C || B` in Figure 9c a typo? Or what is `||`?

Some agreements we made for the spec:

- It looks like we want to not parameterize everything via a monad m.
  This was supposed to be used for actions the players can perform. But
  we'd rather make the outputs explicit.

- For now, we'll try to implement stage 1 of the protocol by using
  a single "event":
  ```
  data StakeHolder = Stakeholder (SlotNumber -> [Chain] -> ([Chain], Stakeholder))
  ```

  The simulator would then call each player once for every slot, passing
  all chains received during the previous slot. The outputs are all chains
  produced by the player during that slot, and its own behaviour in the
  future.

  There would be an implicit assumption that the simulator must call
  each player once per slot number, with strictly increasing slot numbers.

- We should augment each definition in the code with a pointer to the
  part of the paper defining the corresponding concept.

- We will model the blockchains as including the genesis block.
